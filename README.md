# Tesla and GameStop Stock Analysis

This project provides an analysis of historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME). It uses the `yfinance` Python library to fetch real-time stock data and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping revenue data. The analysis is visualized using the `plotly` library to create interactive graphs.

## Visualizations

Below are snapshots of the historical share price graphs generated by this analysis.

### Tesla Historical Share Price

This graph displays the historical share price of Tesla (TSLA). The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis shows the price in USD. The chart includes a rangeslider for a more detailed view of specific time periods. A significant surge in stock price can be observed in recent years.

### GameStop Historical Share Price

This graph illustrates the historical share price of GameStop (GME). Similar to the Tesla chart, it plots price against date with an interactive rangeslider. The graph notably captures the dramatic spike in GME's stock price, reflecting its high volatility.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python**: The core programming language for the analysis.
*   **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code development and visualization.
*   **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **yfinance**: To fetch real-time and historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance.
*   **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to get web page content.
*   **BeautifulSoup4**: For parsing HTML and XML documents to scrape data.
*   **Plotly**: For creating interactive and publication-quality graphs.

## Steps Taken

This project follows a structured approach to fetch, process, and visualize stock data.

1.  **Environment Setup**: The necessary Python libraries (`yfinance`, `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `plotly`) are installed using pip.

2.  **Tesla Stock Data Extraction**:
    *   The `yfinance` library is used to create a Ticker object for Tesla (`TSLA`).
    *   The complete historical stock data for Tesla is fetched using the `.history(period="max")` function.
    *   The index of the resulting DataFrame is reset to make the 'Date' a column.

3.  **Tesla Revenue Data Web Scraping**:
    *   The URL for Tesla's revenue data on `macrotrends.net` is defined.
    *   The `requests` library is used to download the webpage's HTML content.
    *   `BeautifulSoup` is employed to parse the HTML and locate the table containing the revenue data.
    *   A pandas DataFrame is created to store the scraped 'Date' and 'Revenue' information.

4.  **GameStop Stock Data Extraction**:
    *   Similar to Tesla, a `yfinance` Ticker object is created for GameStop (`GME`).
    *   The entire historical stock data is downloaded and processed into a DataFrame.

5.  **GameStop Revenue Data Web Scraping**:
    *   The same web scraping process is repeated for GameStop's revenue data from `macrotrends.net`.

6.  **Data Visualization**:
    *   A reusable function `make_graph` is defined using `plotly.graph_objects` to create a two-panel dashboard.
    *   The top panel displays the historical share price (Close price).
    *   The bottom panel shows the historical revenue.
    *   This function is called for both Tesla and GameStop to generate the final visualizations.
